*Sequel blight is an independent h-game developed on RPG Maker, by the doujin circle Leaf Geometry. It is composed only of hakika, who has developed many games over the years. The game is available on DLSite. You can find a (awesome) fan translation here*

*At first glance, Sequel fantasy setting and RPG Maker graphics can seem very generic. However, nothing is. It contains original monsters, quests, and fun interactions. Sequel tricks you by being one of this “old game” from simpler times while being fresh, modern, and enticing. Sequel main appeal would be its pacing. Similar to Ateliers games, it revolves around a very short gameplay loop. You explore, fight monsters, have some banter/story, maybe get back to the base for gear and (occasionally lewd) interactions and you start it again. This makes the game play itself for long or short playtime. If your party gets wiped, judiciously placed teleporters ensure that it’s never a pain to get back where you died. You can build your character wisely, but it’s easy to respec at any time*
